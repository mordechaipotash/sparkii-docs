# iamwhoiam DID Protocol
*Wiki Entry | Created: 2025-09-04 | Source: July 2025 Portfolio Documentation*

## Executive Summary
iamwhoiam is a decentralized identity (DID) protocol that enables **zero-knowledge reputation proofs** through BBS+ signatures and SnarkJS circuits. Users can prove claims about their identity and reputation without revealing any actual identifying information.

## Core Technology

### Foundation Stack
```yaml
Identity_Protocol: did:key
Signature_Scheme: BBS+ (BLS12-381)
Proof_System: SnarkJS (Groth16)
Selective_Disclosure: BBS+ native support
Privacy_Level: Zero-knowledge
```

### The Three-Layer Architecture

#### Layer 1: Identity Foundation
- **Self-Sovereign**: Users control their own keys
- **Decentralized**: No central authority required
- **Portable**: Identity works across platforms
- **Persistent**: Cryptographically secured

#### Layer 2: Credential Management  
- **BBS+ Signatures**: Enable selective disclosure
- **Attribute-Based**: Multiple claims per credential
- **Unlinkable**: Different uses can't be correlated
- **Revocable**: Without breaking privacy

#### Layer 3: Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- **Threshold Proofs**: Prove value > X without revealing value
- **Set Membership**: Prove inclusion without revealing which
- **Range Proofs**: Prove value within range
- **Composite Proofs**: Multiple conditions simultaneously

## Technical Implementation

### DID Document Structure
```json
{
  "id": "did:key:zUC7...abc",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:key:zUC7...abc#zUC7...abc",
    "type": "BLS12381G2Key2020",
    "controller": "did:key:zUC7...abc",
    "publicKeyBase58": "..."
  }],
  "authentication": ["did:key:zUC7...abc#zUC7...abc"],
  "assertionMethod": ["did:key:zUC7...abc#zUC7...abc"],
  "capabilityDelegation": ["did:key:zUC7...abc#zUC7...abc"],
  "capabilityInvocation": ["did:key:zUC7...abc#zUC7...abc"]
}
```

### BBS+ Signature Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Issuer
    participant Verifier
    
    User->>Issuer: Request credential
    Issuer->>User: Issue BBS+ signed credential
    User->>User: Generate selective disclosure proof
    User->>Verifier: Present ZK proof
    Verifier->>Verifier: Verify without learning identity
    Verifier->>User: Grant/Deny access
```

### Zero-Knowledge Circuit
```javascript
// Core reputation threshold circuit
circuit ReputationThreshold() {
  // Private signals (hidden from verifier)
  signal private input reputation;
  signal private input nonce;
  signal private input identity_commitment;
  
  // Public signals (visible to verifier)
  signal input threshold;
  signal input challenge;
  signal output valid;
  
  // Constraint: reputation must exceed threshold
  component gte = GreaterEqualThan(64);
  gte.in[0] <== reputation;
  gte.in[1] <== threshold;
  valid <== gte.out;
  
  // Prevent replay attacks
  signal nonceHash <== Poseidon(nonce);
  nonceHash === challenge;
}
```

## Privacy Features

### Selective Disclosure Capabilities
| What You Can Prove | What Remains Hidden |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Age > 18 | Exact birthdate |
| Income > $50k | Actual income |
| Reputation > 750 | Exact score |
| Member of group | Which member |
| Owns credential | Identity of owner |

### Unlinkability Guarantees
- **Different Proofs**: Can't be connected to same user
- **Multiple Presentations**: Each is cryptographically unique
- **Cross-Platform**: Usage on one platform doesn't affect another
- **Time-Separated**: Past and future uses uncorrelatable

## Integration Architecture

### With ZMAT Protocol
```yaml
Data_Flow:
  1. ZMAT generates reputation scores
  2. Scores imported into iamwhoiam credentials  
  3. User creates ZK proofs of reputation
  4. Verifier checks without learning identity

Benefits:
  - Portable reputation across platforms
  - Privacy-preserving verification
  - No central reputation authority
  - Sybil-resistant through ZMAT scoring
```

### With WOTCFY Platform
```yaml
Use_Cases:
  - Anonymous job applications
  - Bias-free skill verification
  - Privacy-preserving background checks
  - Reputation-based matching

Integration_Points:
  - Credential issuance for verified skills
  - ZK proofs for application requirements
  - Selective disclosure for interviews
  - Post-hire identity revelation
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Core API structure
interface IamWhoIamAPI {
  // Identity operations
  createDID(): Promise<DIDDocument>
  resolveDID(did: string): Promise<DIDDocument>
  
  // Credential operations
  issueCredential(claims: Claims): Promise<Credential>
  verifyCredential(credential: Credential): Promise<boolean>
  
  // Proof operations
  generateProof(credential: Credential, disclosure: Disclosure): Promise<Proof>
  verifyProof(proof: Proof, challenge: string): Promise<boolean>
  
  // Reputation bridge
  importZMATScore(score: number, signature: string): Promise<Credential>
  proveReputationThreshold(threshold: number): Promise<Proof>
}
```

## Security Model

### Threat Mitigation
| Attack Vector | Defense Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Identity theft | Cryptographic key control |
| Credential forgery | BBS+ signature verification |
| Replay attacks | Nonce-based challenges |
| Correlation attacks | Unlinkable proofs |
| Man-in-middle | TLS + proof binding |
| Sybil attacks | ZMAT reputation requirement |

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **BLS12-381**: Pairing-friendly elliptic curve
- **BBS+**: Signature scheme with selective disclosure
- **Poseidon Hash**: ZK-friendly hash function
- **Groth16**: Succinct NIZK proof system

## Philosophy & Vision

### The Core Principle
**"Identity is about proving claims, not revealing information."**

### The Paradigm Shift
From: "Show me who you are" → "Prove what I need to know"
From: "Trust requires transparency" → "Trust requires proof"
From: "Privacy OR functionality" → "Privacy AND functionality"

### The Ultimate Goal
Create a world where every human can:
- **Prove anything** without revealing everything
- **Maintain privacy** while building reputation  
- **Control identity** across all platforms
- **Interact freely** without surveillance
