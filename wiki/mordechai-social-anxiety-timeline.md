**Critical Self-Disclosure**:
> "So, when I'm hyper-focused, as I've said before many times, it's as if everything else in the world is dead to me, and I'm 100% focused on whatever the object of my focus is. I also allow myself the luxury of being completely in that moment and because everything else around me is dead, my time management executive function and everything is very compromised and even how long I will spend on it and what the outcome will be is unknown. And essentially this is my biggest disability. Ironically, my biggest strength is my first principal's ability to hyperfocus."

**Key Problems Identified**:
- Theory of mind struggles in social interactions
- Avoidance of overwhelming situations that then "fester and cause much bigger problems"
- Inability to return to important projects despite their significance
- No benefit from previous hyperfocus deep dives

- **Messages**: 33
- **Source**: `chatgpt-desktop`

**Core Pattern Recognition**:
> "On a day-to-day basis, my biggest functional barrier to success is the autistic trait of absolutely hyper-focusing with an urgency that I basically have to complete whatever the task on hand is, even though when I look back at a later stage it might not necessarily actually be as important as I thought it might be, and the more deregulated I feel at that time, the more I feel an urgency to cling on to those hyper-focused states."
