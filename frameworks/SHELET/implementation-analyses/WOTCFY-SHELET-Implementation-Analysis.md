Complex Tax Code → AI Processing → "Trust me, this person is eligible"
Result: Human confusion, low adoption, high error rates
```

**WOTCFY/SHELET Approach:**
```
Complex Tax Code → AI Analysis → "Here are 4 decisions with evidence"
Result: 100% human understanding, high confidence, accurate outcomes
```

## Technical Architecture: SHELET in Code

### Database-Driven Intelligence
```typescript
// Zero hardcoded prompts - all AI behavior configurable
const PROMPT_ID = 'wotc_extraction_v2';
const promptConfig = await getPromptConfig(PROMPT_ID);

// Hot-swappable models without deployment
model: promptConfig.model, // Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, Claude, GPT-4
temperature: parseFloat(promptConfig.temperature),
max_tokens: parseInt(promptConfig.max_tokens)
```

### JSONB Flexibility with Type Safety
```typescript
// Infinite adaptability with TypeScript safety
interface JsonbApplicant {
  personal: PersonalInfo;
  address: AddressInfo;  
  forms: FormsData;
  eligibility: EligibilityCalculation;
  verification: VerificationStatus;
}
```

### Real-time Human Decision Pipeline
```typescript
// 27+ real-time connections for instant human feedback
const channel = supabase
  .channel('verification-updates')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public', 
    table: 'wotc_applicants'
  }, handleRealtimeUpdate)
```

### The Verification State Machine
```typescript
// Clear progression through SHELET phases
type ApplicantStatus = 
  | 'processing'    // Phase 1-2: AI extraction
  | 'pending'       // Phase 3: Awaiting human decision
