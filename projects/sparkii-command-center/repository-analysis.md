  🚀 Consolidation Opportunities

  1. Unified Dashboard Architecture 🎯

  Current State: 3 separate Next.js apps (mordechai-plus, temp-wotcfy-analysis, main dashboard)

  Opportunity: Create a single, modular dashboard with:
  /dashboard
  ├── /youtube      // YouTube pipeline management
  ├── /conversations // Chat intelligence & search  
  ├── /wotcfy       // Tax credit processing
  ├── /analytics    // Cross-system insights
  └── /ai-ops       // AI model management & costs

  Benefits: Reduced maintenance, shared components, unified auth, cross-system insights

  2. Centralized AI Orchestration 🤖

  Current State: AI calls scattered across different applications

  Opportunity: Implement the Sparkii Prompt Management System:
  - Database-driven prompt storage

  - Cost tracking and optimization
  - A/B testing for prompt performance
  - Zero-deployment prompt updates

  3. Knowledge Graph Integration 🕸️

  Current State: Separate silos of YouTube, chat, and business data

  Opportunity: Create unified knowledge graph:
  -- Unified knowledge table
  CREATE TABLE sparkii_knowledge (
      id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
      source_type TEXT, -- 'youtube', 'chat', 'document', 'business'
      content_vector VECTOR(384),
      business_score DECIMAL,
      tags JSONB,
      relationships JSONB
  );

  4. Process Automation Hub ⚡

  Current State: Multiple Python scripts for different processes

  Opportunity: Unified process orchestration:
  - Single scheduler for all automation
  - Process dependency management
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Performance monitoring dashboard
