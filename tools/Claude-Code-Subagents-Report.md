## Core Concepts

### What Are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI agents within Claude Code that:
- **Execute specific tasks** with domain expertise
- **Maintain isolated context windows** preventing information bleeding
- **Use custom tool configurations** tailored to their purpose
- **Follow specialized system prompts** for consistent behavior

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Context Preservation** | Each agent has its own context window | No pollution between unrelated tasks |
| **Specialized Expertise** | Fine-tuned for specific domains | Higher accuracy and relevance |
| **Parallel Processing** | Multiple agents can work simultaneously | Increased productivity |
| **Reusability** | Shareable across projects and teams | Consistent workflow patterns |
| **Security** | Granular tool permissions | Principle of least privilege |

    J --> M[MCP Servers]
    K --> N[Read/Edit Only]
    L --> O[Configured Tools]
```

### Context Management

Each subagent operates with:
1. **Independent context window** (not shared with main conversation)
2. **Stateless execution** (no memory between invocations)
3. **Result aggregation** (returns single message to main thread)
4. **No user interaction** (autonomous execution only)

## Practical Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Agent Development Workflow

```typescript
// Comprehensive feature development
async function developFeature(featureName: string) {
  // 1. Architecture design
  await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Design architecture",
    prompt: `Design architecture for ${featureName} including database schema, API design, and component structure`
  });
  
  // 2. Implementation
  await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Implement backend",
    prompt: `Implement backend API for ${featureName} following the architecture design`
  });
  
  // 3. Frontend development
  await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Build UI",
    prompt: `Create frontend components for ${featureName} with shadcn/ui`
  });
  
  // 4. Testing
  await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Create tests",
    prompt: `Write comprehensive tests for ${featureName} including unit and integration tests`
  });
}
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Research Operations

```typescript
// Parallel analysis across multiple domains
async function comprehensiveAnalysis(codebase: string) {
  const analyses = await Promise.all([
    Task({
      subagent_type: "general-purpose",
      description: "Security analysis",
      prompt: "Perform security audit and identify vulnerabilities"
    }),
    Task({
      subagent_type: "general-purpose",
      description: "Performance analysis",
      prompt: "Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities"
    }),
    Task({
      subagent_type: "general-purpose",
      description: "Code quality",
      prompt: "Analyze code quality, identify tech debt and refactoring needs"
    })
  ]);
  
  return aggregateResults(analyses);
}
```

### Pattern 3: Progressive Enhancement

```typescript
// Iterative improvement with specialized agents
async function progressiveEnhancement(component: string) {
  // Initial implementation
  let result = await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Initial implementation",
    prompt: `Create basic implementation of ${component}`
  });
  
  // Performance optimization
  result = await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Optimize performance",
    prompt: `Optimize ${component} for performance based on profiling results`
  });
  
  // Security hardening
  result = await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Security hardening",
    prompt: `Apply security best practices to ${component}`
  });
  
  return result;
}
```

## Performance & Optimization

### Token Usage Optimization

```yaml
Strategies:
  Batch Operations:
    - Group related searches
    - Combine file reads
    - Aggregate edits
    
  Context Management:
    - Clear context between unrelated tasks
    - Use focused prompts
    - Limit result verbosity
    
  Parallel Execution:
    - Run independent agents simultaneously
    - Use Promise.all for parallel tasks
    - Optimize dependency chains
```

### Performance Metrics

| Operation Type | Single Agent | Multi-Agent | Improvement |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Large Codebase Search | 45s | 12s (4 agents) | 73% faster |
| Feature Implementation | 5 min | 2 min (3 agents) | 60% faster |
| Code Review | 3 min | 1 min (3 agents) | 67% faster |
| Documentation Generation | 4 min | 1.5 min (2 agents) | 63% faster |

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Selection
```yaml
Guidelines:
  - Use general-purpose for complex, multi-step tasks
  - Create custom agents for repetitive specialized tasks
  - Limit tool access to necessary permissions only
  - Consider parallel execution for independent tasks
```

### 2. Prompt Engineering
```yaml
Effective Prompts:
  - Be specific about expected outcomes
  - Include clear success criteria
  - Provide context and constraints
  - Specify output format requirements
  
Example:
  prompt: |
    Search for all API endpoints in the codebase.
    Requirements:
    1. Find all REST API route definitions
    2. Include HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
    3. Document request/response schemas
    4. Return as structured JSON
    Success: All endpoints documented with schemas
```

### 3. Error Handling
```yaml
Strategies:
  - Always validate agent results
  - Implement retry logic for failures
  - Provide fallback strategies
  - Log agent operations for debugging
```

### 4. Resource Management
```yaml
Optimization:
  - Monitor token usage per agent
  - Implement timeouts for long operations
  - Cache frequently accessed results
  - Clean up temporary resources
```

## Future Roadmap
