  🎯 Custom Command Architecture

  1. Slash Commands System

  Core Concepts

  - Syntax: /command-name [arguments]
  - Discovery: Type / to see all available commands
  - Scope Levels: Project-specific, user-global, and MCP-provided
  - Storage Locations:
    - Project commands: .claude/commands/
    - Personal commands: ~/.claude/commands/
    - MCP commands: Dynamically discovered from connected servers

  Command Types

  Built-in Commands
  - /clear - Clear conversation
  - /help - Display help information
  - /review - Trigger code review
  - /model - Switch AI models
  - /permissions - View/modify permissions
  - /mcp - Display MCP server status

  Custom Commands
  - Created as Markdown files in command directories
  - Support namespacing through folder structures
  - Can include frontmatter metadata for configuration

  Advanced Features

  Argument Support
  - $ARGUMENTS - Captures all arguments passed
  - $1, $2, etc. - Positional argument placeholders
  - Example: /fix-issue $ARGUMENTS passes entire argument string

  Frontmatter Configuration
  ---
  allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*)
  argument-hint: [message]
  description: Create a git commit
  model: claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
  ---

  Special Prefixes
  - ! prefix - Execute bash commands before prompt
  - @ prefix - Include file contents in prompt
  - # prefix - Quick memory additions

  ---
  🔧 Configuration Hierarchy

  2. CLAUDE.md System

  Purpose & Structure

  CLAUDE.md files serve as project memory and configuration, storing:
  - Project conventions and patterns
  - Key commands and workflows
  - Technical decisions and context
  - Team-specific guidelines

  Hierarchical Loading

  1. Global: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  2. Project: [project-root]/CLAUDE.md
  3. Directory: [subdirectory]/CLAUDE.md
  4. Local overrides: CLAUDE.local.md (git-ignored)

  Best Practices

  - Keep CLAUDE.md under 1000 lines for optimal performance
  - Extract repeated workflows to slash commands
  - Use .llm/ directories for additional context
  - Include key commands and project-specific patterns

  🌐 MCP Integration

  3. Model Context Protocol Commands

  MCP Slash Commands

  - Format: /mcp__server-name__prompt-name
  - Dynamically discovered from connected servers
  - Support server-specific arguments and configurations

  Popular MCP Servers (2025)

  1. Supabase - Database operations
  2. GitHub - Repository management
  3. Railway - Deployment operations
  4. Desktop Commander - File system operations
  5. Puppeteer - Browser automation
  6. Notion - Documentation management
  7. Exa - Web search and research

  Configuration Methods

  - CLI wizard: claude mcp add
  - Manual configuration in .claude/settings.local.json
  - Project-specific: .claude/mcp.json
  - User-global: ~/.claude/mcp.json

  ---
  ⚙️ Settings & Configuration

  4. Settings.json Structure

  Settings Hierarchy

  5. Enterprise/Managed settings (highest priority)
  6. User settings: ~/.claude/settings.json
  7. Project settings: .claude/settings.json
  8. Local overrides: .claude/settings.local.json

  Key Configuration Options

  {
    "permissions": {
      "deny": ["*.env", "secrets/*"]
    },
    "hooks": {
      "UserPromptSubmit": [],
      "ToolExecute": []
    },
    "mcpServers": {
      "server-name": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@package/server"]
      }
    }
  }

  ---
  🪝 Hooks System

  9. Lifecycle Hooks

  Available Hook Events

  - UserPromptSubmit - Before prompt processing
  - ToolExecute - Before tool execution
  - FileChange - After file modifications
  - SessionStart - When session begins
  - SessionEnd - When session ends

  Hook Configuration Example

  {
    "hooks": {
      "UserPromptSubmit": [
        {
          "matcher": ".*",
          "hooks": [
            {
              "type": "command",
              "command": "echo 'User submitted: $PROMPT' >> session.log"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  Security Considerations

  - Hooks run with user permissions
  - Can modify/delete any accessible files
  - Should validate and sanitize inputs
  - Use absolute paths for safety
