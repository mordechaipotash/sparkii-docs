## Purpose
Deep analysis of Mordechai's SHELET framework from novel perspectives, creating insightful draft reports that explore compression, sovereignty, and bottleneck-amplifier dynamics. Reads all verified content first to ensure novel insights.

## Supabase Access
```yaml
Project: Sparkii
Project ID: ppxclcyrnuactlfhmchm

Available Data:
- 11,270 AI Chat Histories (clean_chat_histories)
- SHELET crystallization records (shelet_crystallized)
- Temporal Range: May 2023 - September 2025
```

## Command Structure
```bash
/shelet-draft                           # Create draft from chat analysis
/shelet-draft --topic "compression"     # Focus on specific SHELET aspect

```

## Core Analysis Process

When invoked, I will:

### Step 1: Read All Verified Content
- Scan `/Users/mordechai/Sparkii/sparkii-command-center/Sparkii_Docs/understanding shelet/verified/`
- Extract existing SHELET perspectives and insights
- Identify gaps in current understanding
- Map covered and uncovered territory

### Step 2: Query SHELET Database Records
```yaml
mcp: supabase_sparkii.execute_sql
params:
  project_id: "ppxclcyrnuactlfhmchm"
  query: |
    SELECT 
      crystallization_id,
      domain,
      crystallization_type,
      crystallized_data->>'summary' as summary,
      crystallized_data->'compression_phases' as phases,
      quality_score
    FROM public.shelet_crystallized
    WHERE domain IN ('sovereignty', 'framework', 'compression')
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
```

### Step 3: Analyze Chat Conversations
```yaml
mcp: supabase_sparkii.execute_sql
params:
  project_id: "ppxclcyrnuactlfhmchm"
  query: |
    SELECT 
      conversation_id,
      title,
      content,
      total_messages,
      occurred_at
    FROM public.clean_chat_histories
    WHERE (content::text ILIKE '%shelet%' OR 
           content::text ILIKE '%compression%' OR
           content::text ILIKE '%bottleneck%amplifier%' OR
           content::text ILIKE '%sovereignty%' OR
           title ILIKE '%shelet%')
    ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
    LIMIT 20
```

## Novelty Detection Algorithm

Before creating any draft, I will:

1. **Content Fingerprinting**: Create semantic fingerprints of all verified content
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify unexplored angles and perspectives
3. **Uniqueness Verification**: Ensure >70% novel content vs existing material
4. **Insight Validation**: Confirm the insight adds value to SHELET understanding
5. **Integration Check**: Verify compatibility with existing framework

## Quality Thresholds

Draft reports must meet:
- **Novelty Score**: >70% new insights vs verified content
- **SHELET Alignment**: Full compatibility with 4-phase framework
- **Sovereignty Score**: 100% human agency preservation
- **Evidence Base**: Grounded in actual data from Sparkii database
- **Practical Value**: Clear applications and implementation paths

## Error Handling

If no novel insights can be generated:
1. Report which verified content blocks the angle
2. Suggest alternative perspectives to explore
3. Recommend synthesis approaches across existing insights
4. Identify specific gaps that need more foundational work

## Integration with /shelet-iterate

Each draft includes:
- **7 specific questions** for iterative improvement
- **Verification criteria checklist** for promotion readiness
- **Draft ID** for tracking through iteration process
- **Integration hooks** for connecting with other SHELET insights

## The Pashut Truth

This command transforms the infinite space of possible SHELET insights into focused draft analyses that preserve 100% sovereignty while creating novel understanding. Every draft becomes a bottleneck that amplifies into deeper SHELET comprehension.
