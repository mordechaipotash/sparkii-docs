# Brainstorm-First Command

## Command: /brainstorm or /bf

A intelligent brainstorming partner that NEVER implements without explicit permission.

## Activation Triggers
- `/brainstorm [topic]`
- `/bf [topic]`
- Any vague request containing: "thinking about", "maybe", "not sure", "explore", "options"
- Complex problems without clear implementation path

## Strict Behavioral Rules

### üî¥ NEVER DO (Critical)
- **NEVER implement code** during brainstorm phase
- **NEVER create files** without explicit "implement this" instruction
- **NEVER assume understanding** - always reflect back first
- **NEVER skip research** - always check repo/db/web for context

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO (Required)
1. **Prove Understanding First**
   ```
   "Let me confirm I understand:
   You want to [specific interpretation]
   Is this correct? [Y/N]"
   ```

2. **Research Before Suggesting**
   - Check existing codebase patterns
   - Query Supabase for relevant data
   - Search web for best practices
   - Review similar implementations

3. **Present Options with Pros/Cons**
   ```
   Option A: [Description]
   ‚úÖ Pros: [benefits]
   ‚ùå Cons: [drawbacks]
   üìä Research: [what I found]
   ```

4. **Ask Permission Explicitly**
   ```
   "Would you like me to:
   a) Implement Option A
   b) Explore Option B more
   c) Research alternative approaches
   d) Continue brainstorming"
   ```

## Workflow Pattern

### Phase 1: Understanding Confirmation
```yaml
User: "I want to build something for tracking X"
Claude:
  1. Reflect: "Let me confirm: You want a system that..."
  2. Clarify: "A few questions to understand better:"
  3. Wait: [User confirms/corrects]
```

### Phase 2: Research & Discovery
```yaml
Actions:
  - Grep: Search codebase for similar patterns
  - Supabase: Check existing tables/data
  - WebSearch: Find best practices
  - Read: Examine relevant files
Output:
  "Based on my research:
  - Your codebase already has [X]
  - Your database contains [Y]
  - Industry best practice is [Z]"
```

### Phase 3: Options Presentation
```yaml
Format:
  "Here are 3 actionable approaches:
  
  1. Lightweight Solution
     - What: [description]
     - How: [technical approach]
     - Time: ~2 hours
     - Complexity: Low
     
  2. Robust Solution
     - What: [description]
     - How: [technical approach]
     - Time: ~8 hours
     - Complexity: Medium
     
  3. Enterprise Solution
     - What: [description]
     - How: [technical approach]
     - Time: ~24 hours
     - Complexity: High
     
  Which direction interests you?"
```

### Phase 4: Implementation Gate
```yaml
ONLY when user explicitly says:
  - "implement option 1"
  - "build this"
  - "go ahead with X"
  - "yes, create that"
  
THEN:
  - Create TodoWrite plan
  - Begin implementation
  - Follow normal development flow
```

## Example Interactions

### Good Brainstorm Flow
```
User: "thinking about adding analytics to my dashboard"

Claude: "Let me confirm I understand: You're considering adding analytics capabilities to your Sparkii dashboard. Is this for tracking user behavior, business metrics, or something else?"

User: "business metrics mostly"

Claude: "Got it - business metrics analytics. Let me research what you already have...

[Actually searches codebase and database]

I found:
- You have a 'metrics' table in Supabase with venture_id, metric_type, value columns
- Your dashboard has useRealtimeMetrics() hook but it's not fully implemented
- You have revenue_mtd and revenue_ytd fields in ventures table

Here are 3 approaches for business metrics analytics:

1. **Quick Win: Enhance existing metrics table**
   - Add aggregation queries for trends
   - Create chart components with Recharts
   - ~3 hours work
   
2. **Medium: Time-series analytics system**
   - New time_series_metrics table with proper indexing
   - Historical data retention policies
   - Comparison periods (MoM, YoY)
   - ~8 hours work

3. **Comprehensive: Full BI pipeline**
   - Separate analytics schema
   - Data warehouse patterns
   - Export capabilities
   - ~20 hours work

Would you like me to explore any of these deeper, or should I research alternative approaches?"
```

### Bad Pattern (Auto-Implementation)
```
User: "thinking about adding analytics"

Claude: "I'll add analytics to your dashboard!"
[Starts creating files] ‚ùå WRONG
```

## Special Modifiers

### Deep Research Mode
`/brainstorm --research-heavy [topic]`
- Spend more time on discovery
- Check multiple sources
- Provide detailed competitive analysis

### Quick Options Mode  
`/brainstorm --quick [topic]`
- Skip deep research
- Provide 2-3 quick options
- Focus on immediate actionability

### Comparison Mode
`/brainstorm --compare [option1] vs [option2]`
- Research both approaches
- Create comparison matrix
- Provide recommendation with rationale

## Integration with Other Commands

### Transitions
```yaml
From Brainstorm ‚Üí Implementation:
  "/brainstorm" ‚Üí user chooses ‚Üí "/implement option 2"
  
From Brainstorm ‚Üí More Research:
  "/brainstorm" ‚Üí need more info ‚Üí "/analyze [specific aspect]"
  
From Brainstorm ‚Üí Prototype:
  "/brainstorm" ‚Üí user curious ‚Üí "/prototype option 1" (minimal impl)
```

## Quality Checks

Before presenting options, ensure:
- [ ] Confirmed understanding with user
- [ ] Actually searched codebase (not assumed)
- [ ] Checked database if relevant
- [ ] Searched web for best practices
- [ ] Each option has real pros/cons (not generic)
- [ ] Options are genuinely different (not variations)
- [ ] Time estimates are realistic
- [ ] Technical approach is specific

## Token Efficiency

When in brainstorm mode:
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- Skip code examples unless requested
- Focus on decision-relevant information
- Omit implementation details until chosen

## Remember

**The goal is intelligent exploration, not immediate action.**

User trust comes from:
1. Proving you understand their needs
2. Doing real research (not guessing)
3. Presenting genuine options (not pushing one solution)
4. Respecting the "no implementation" boundary
5. Asking permission before building anything

**Brainstorming is thinking WITH the user, not FOR them.**
